They need to be able to have a markup from cost of 43 % on Initiative, 5 Star and Q Connect Items and a 38 % markup on everything else.
The solution to this is to have all of the Initiative, 5 Star and Q Connect Items in Price band A and all of the other items in price band Z. The customers who they want to apply this to will need to have mark up from cost contract prices setup on price band A and Z to enable this. 
Price Band A – Contract Price Of Cost Plus 43%
Spicers 5 Star 
Vow Q Connect
Braymore Spicers 5 Star 
Initiative Spicers 
Initiative Bramore
Initiative Antalis
Initiative Vow

Price Band Z – Contract Price Of Cost Plus 38 %
Everything else in the above price lists.

BOSS Level Contracts 
They also have Boss Level Mark-Up from cost contracts, which are cheaper so will override the above if relevant.
CATERING – 18% mark up from cost
JANITORIAL – 18 % mark up from cost
PRINTER/WP SUPPLIES – 28 % mark up from cost

Instructions for loading of Price Files each quarter.
1.	Load Spicers, Spicers Braymore and Vow via Pulselink. Double check the opdata.txt contains initiative codes, they’ve been known to send the wrong file!
2.	Load Antalis File obtained from Antalis.
3.	Open their database in Access, open the query ‘Update Antalis, Vow and Spicers and Spicer Bray to Z - run first’ and change the Antalis ID (currently 67 to the new ID). Do the same on the query ‘Update Vow Initiative Antalis Initiative Q and 5 star to Band A’

4.	Run these three queries in the order below.

Update Antalis, Vow and Spicers and Spicer Bray to Z - run first’’ one first.

Update Spicers Initiative to Band A

Update Vow Initiative Antalis Initiative Q and 5 star to Band A

5.	Re-send the Antalis, Spicers, Spicers Braymore and Vow to the web.
6.	If contracts have expired (Jan update), then extend contract expiry dates.",TRUE,,,,0
